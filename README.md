# Pokemon-Gotta-Find-Them-All
The Pokemon: Got 2 Find Them All!, is a single-player GUI-based
game in which the player is presented with a grid of \`tall grass\' squares. Some tall grass squares
hide Pokemon, and some do not. The aim of the game is to `catch' all Pokemon by right-clicking
on the tall grass under which they hide, and to clear a safe path for other trainers by left-clicking
on the tall grass squares in which Pokemon are not hiding. Left-clicking on a tall grass square in
which a Pokemon is hiding will scare the Pokemon into battle, and as your player has ventured out
without any Pokemon of their own this will cause them to lose the game. To assist your player on
their quest, when a blank tall grass square is revealed the number of Pokemon in adjacent squares
should be displayed on that square.

### By changing the Grid_size and Num_poke and Task One/Two at the end of code, you can set the Degree of difficulty. 
```python
    PokemonGame(root,10,15,TASK_TWO) #10 is Grid_size, 15 is Num_poke.
                                     #Task_two is the game with the pokemon image, Task_one is the basis idea of this game.
